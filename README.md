# Project Euler Problems
I'm uploading my solutions for my own personal uses. If you need help with a problem, Project Euler encourages you to explore every other option before looking at another coder's source code.

I've been solving these problems for a while now and have just started uploading them. They work as intended but might not be the most efficient solution. How I solved a problem a couple years ago **won't be indicative of my current skill set** so please don't try to extrapolate anything about me from these solutions :P
